### 84codes CLA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects
(“Projects”) made available by 84codes AB or its affiliates (“84codes”). In
order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions
from any person or entity, 84codes must have a Contributor License
Agreement (“CLA”) or (“Agreement”). This CLA is for your protection as a
Contributor as well as the protection of 84codes.

If you have any questions respecting this Agreement, please contact
contact@lavinmq.com.



1. Definitions ”You” (or ”Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
84codes. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all
other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For
the purposes of this definition, “control”, means (i) the power, direct or
indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether
by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more
of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
“Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, such as but not limited to
source code, object code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools,
documentation, data, feedback, that is intentionally submitted by You
to 84codes for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products
owned or managed by 84codes (the “Work”). For the purposes of this
definition, “submitted” means any for of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to 84codes or its representatives, including but not
limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
behalf of, 84codes for the purpose of discussing and improving the
Work.

    You agree that the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to 84codes. Except for the licenses
granted herein to 84codes and recipients of software distributed by
84codes, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your
Contributions.


2. Grant of Copyright License. You hereby grant to 84codes and to
recipients of software distributed by 84codes a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty free, irrevocable, transferable

patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity
institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution,
or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall
